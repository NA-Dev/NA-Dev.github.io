After working for several years in development and engineering, I am now a University of Virginia School of Data Science Masters candidate set to graduate in May 2021. I am currently looking for work, so feel free to reach out with any opportunities.",
    "bio": [
      "I was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama -- Roll Tide! -- to a long line of crafters and mechanics. Being the first in my family to attend college, I was unfamiliar with the professional world and unsure what major to choose. Having excelled in math and science, I stuck to my roots and majored in mechanical engineering.",
      "Working in the engineering field gave me ample opportunity to experiment with innovative approaches to longstanding problems. I helped improving automotive interior manufacturing, sent cryogenic freezers I helped build to the International Space Station, and maintained colossal power generation plants. ",
      "However, I often found myself gravitating toward using automation and software rather than mechanics to solve problems. So, after moving away from the industrial deep south to Richmond, Virginia with my fianc√© so he could further his career as a patent attorney, I decided to make a transition. Luckily, there was a coding bootcamp nearby at the University of Richmond. This experience taught me object-oriented programming, and a recommendation from one of my TA's to his boss got me my first programming job. For two years, I honed my programming skills by creating databases and web-apps that helped large and small businesses collect data and automate their daily tasks.",
      "As my company struggled to start using machine learning, I realized there was more for me to learn. For this reason, I could see that mastering Data Science was the next step in my development journey. I am currently finishing a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Virginia so that I can automate data-driven decision making using the most versatile and cutting-edge methods available.",
      "Outside of work I enjoy traveling, cooking international cuisine, video games, painting, woodworking, and other crafts"
