    "description": "I am a self-driven, creative data scientist ready to engage in technical problem solving with my team to produce innovative products. My background in statistical data analysis, web development, engineering, and automation has prepared me with a strong analytical mind and the ability to work in a fast-paced environment.",
    "bio": [
      "I was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama -- Roll Tide! -- to a long line of crafters and mechanics. Being the first in my family to attend college, I was unfamilar with the professional world and unsure what major to choose. Having excelled in math and science, I stuck to my roots and gave mechanical engineering a shot.",
      "Working in the engineering field was a great experience. I was always learning, and had ample opportunity to experiment with innovative approaches to longstanding problems. Some of these experiences included improving automotive interior manufacturing, sending cryogenic freezers I helped build to the International Space Station, and maintaining giant power generation plants. But, I often found myself gravitating toward using automation and software rather than mechanics to solve problems. So, after moving away from the industrial deep south to Richmond, Virginia with my fianc√© so he could further his career as a patent attorney, I decided to make a transition.",
      "Since I loved using code to automate processes, and my current hobby was tinkering with a Raspberry Pi, it seemed obvious that programming was my real passion. Luckily, there was a coding bootcamp nearby at the University of Richmond. This experience taught me object-oriented programming, and a recommendation from one of my TA's to his boss got me my first programming job. For two years, I honed my programming skills by creating databases and web-apps that helped large and small businesses collect data and automate their daily tasks.",
      "One day a project that my team was struggling with made me realize that I was still missing an important skill. Knowing how to automate decisions is one thing, but knowing how to make the optimal decision is even more important. For this reason, I could see that mastering Data Science was the next step in my development journey. I am currently finishing a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Virginia to better myself in this area. As a bonus, this program also gives me experience in machine learning so that I can automate data-driven decision making using the most versatile and cutting-edge methods available."
